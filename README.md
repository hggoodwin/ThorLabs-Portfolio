#Python
This Python CLI application is a lightweight budgeting tool designed to demonstrate core Python fundamentals, input validation, and business-logic implementation. The program prompts users for income frequency and expense data, then calculates monthly income, remaining balance, and allocates funds across savings, leisure, and investments based on user-defined percentages.

#React
This React application is a lightweight, single-page dashboard that simulates an internal manufacturing test results viewer. It displays recent test runs, calculates yield percentage, and visualizes a key measurement (laser power) using a simple chart. The application uses static data to focus on UI structure and state-driven rendering rather than backend integration.
